# Serveable

Serveable simplifies creating a [Rack][rack] mountable site. It contains a
`Site` module and an `Item` module. These can be mixed into classes that expose
the correct interface to turn them into easy Rack-fodder.

See [`example/simple.rb`](examples/simple.rb) for a basic implementation.
